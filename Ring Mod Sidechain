desc:Ring Mod Sidechain
// Signal that is to be sidechained should go to channels 1 and 2.
// Sidechain signal (drums) should go to channels 3 and 4.
//   The sidechain signal should NOT go to the master. The original sidechain is summed by this effect itself.

@sample
sidechain_left_rectified = -abs(spl2);
sidechain_right_rectified = -abs(spl3);

spl0 += (spl0 * sidechain_left_rectified) + spl2;
spl1 += (spl1 * sidechain_right_rectified) + spl3;
